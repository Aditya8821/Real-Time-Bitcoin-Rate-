# Real-Time💹 Bitcoin Rate💲
Here is a python script which checks the Real-Time💹 Bitcoin rates💸 in INR.
- **BeautifulSoup:**
BeautifulSoup is a python library for pulling data out of HTML and XML files
 
- **requests:**
requests module allows you to send HTTP requests and returns a response object with all the response

## **Real-Time Use & Purpose:**
In this project you’ll learn about HTTP requests and how to send them using the requests package and will also learn how to extract required data from HTML pages using some simple functions of beautifulsoup module.
As we all know very well that bitcoin price is a fickle thing. You never really know where it’s going to be at the end of the day. So, instead of constantly checking various sites for the latest updates, let’s make a Python script to do the work for you.

## Procedure to follow: 
- from bs4 import BeautifulSoup
- import requests
- pass page text as argument in BeautifulSoup and parse it.
- pass required class name as argument in soup.find() function.
- print the output in terms of INR
## Sample Output:
